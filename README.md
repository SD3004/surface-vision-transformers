# Surface Vision Transformers

This repository contains codebase to apply vision transformers on surface data. It implements work from [Surface Vision Transformers: Attention-Based Modelling applied to Cortical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16414) in PyTorch.  


Here, Surface Vision Transformer (**SiT**) is applied on cortical data for phenotype predictions.
